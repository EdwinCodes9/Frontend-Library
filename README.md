# Frontend-Library
Welcome to the README section for our React book search application! Our app is built using a PostgreSQL backend and a React front-end that utilizes Axios to make calls to both a 3rd party library API and a custom API that we've created.

The primary function of our application is to allow users to search for books available in the 3rd party API and have full CRUD functionality with our custom API. This functionality includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting books from our custom API.

To handle communication with our backend, we use Axios, which allows for easy implementation of calls to both the 3rd party library API and our custom API. We also use PostgreSQL as our database management system, providing a reliable and scalable solution for handling our data storage needs.

For the front-end of our application, we utilize React, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface that's easily navigable and efficient. Our custom API and PostgreSQL backend ensure that users can search for and manage books.

Additionally, we've implemented Bootstrap into our React book search application, providing an extensive library of pre-built UI components and styling options. This has allowed us to create a clean and visually appealing user interface that's easily customizable and responsive.
